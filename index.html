            <h2 class="subtitle">BRUSHES</h2>
            <h4 class="first">Hacksaw Brushes</h4>
            <p class="first">Made of the highest quality oak, 
                Hacksaw brushes are known for their weight and ability to hold paint 
                in large amounts. Available in different sizes. 
                Starting at $3.00 / brush.</p>
            <h4 class="second">Acrylic Wash Brush</h4>
            <p class="second">The acrylic wash brush is a paint brush that is VERY big. 
                If you purchase a set of paint brushes and notice a brush that is gigantic 
                compared to the rest – it is most likely a wash brush!</p>
            <h4 class="third">Flat Brush</h4>
            <p class="third">
                    The flat brush very closely resembles a wash brush, 
                    except it is not quite as thick and the bristles are typically not as 
                    rounded on the edges.
            </p>
            <h4 class="fourth">Fan Brush</h4>
            <p class="fourth">The fan brush will become your new best friend if you’ve ever 
                tried painting trees, grasses, shrubbery, or even abstract watery 
                types of designs with acrylic paints.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">FRAMES</h2>
            <h4 class="first">Art Frames</h4>
            <p class="first">Assorted frames made of different material, 
                    including MDF, birchwood, and PDE. 
                    Select frames can be sanded and painted according to your needs. 
                    Starting at $2.00 / frame.</p>
            <h4 class="second">Float Frame</h4>
            <p class="second">A type of moulding used for framing canvases. 
                The art is set into the frame from the front so none of the surface is 
                covered.</p>
            <h4 class="third">Veneer</h4>
            <p class="third">Thin sheets of wood that are adhered to frames, 
                furniture, cabinets, etc. Veneers are generally used when large pieces 
                are not available, such as burl, or when the wood is rare or expensive.</p>

            <h4 class="second">Acrylic paints</h4>
            <p class="second">Acrylic paints are extremely versatile, 
                and ideal for fine brushwork, glazing, staining, water media techniques 
                and many more. This smooth and light paint has excellent pigment quality, 
                color strength, and durability.</p>
